## Electron React Boilerplate 

This project was bootstrapped with create-react-app

#### All the initial basic configurations are done. 

- No need to do any manual Webpack configurations

- You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

- If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. 

- Note: `eject` is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!
